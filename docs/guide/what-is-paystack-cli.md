# What is Paystack CLI?

The Paystack CLI is a powerful command-line tool that helps you build, test, and manage your Paystack integration directly from your terminal. It provides a complete interface to the Paystack API without leaving your development environment.

## Features

### Complete Paystack API Access

Access all Paystack API endpoints directly from your terminal. The CLI supports every API resource including transactions, customers, plans, subscriptions, transfers, and more.

### Secure Authentication

Login once using your Paystack account credentials and the CLI securely manages your session. You can switch between multiple integrations if you have them.

### Local Webhook Testing

Test webhooks locally using built-in ngrok integration. The CLI automatically creates a tunnel to your local server and updates your Paystack webhook URL, making webhook development seamless.

### Configuration Management

Configure API settings, request timeouts, and debug modes through an interactive configuration interface. All settings are stored locally and persist across sessions.

### Beautiful Output

All API responses are formatted as readable JSON with syntax highlighting and colored output for better visualization of data.

### Developer Friendly

Built with TypeScript, the CLI provides type safety and excellent developer experience. The codebase is well-structured and easy to extend.

## Why Use Paystack CLI?

### Speed Up Development

Instead of using tools like Postman or writing custom scripts to test API calls, use simple CLI commands to interact with Paystack. This speeds up development and reduces context switching.

### Test Webhooks Easily

Testing webhooks typically requires deploying your code or using complex tunneling setups. Paystack CLI handles all of this automatically with a single command.

### Manage Multiple Integrations

If you manage multiple Paystack integrations, the CLI makes it easy to switch between them without changing environment variables or configuration files.

### Learn the API

The CLI is also a great learning tool. By using it, you'll become familiar with Paystack's API structure, parameters, and responses.
